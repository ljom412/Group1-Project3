Project overview & purpose: <br>
A statistical analysis of the top 5 coffee importing and re-exporting countries, and the pricing effect that it has caused in raw coffee beans.<br>

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project: <br>
- The homepage displays a Leaflet map of the top 5 coffee importing countries (USA, Germany, Japan, Italy, & France) between 1990 - 2018.<br>
- The dropdown box displays different statistics on imports, re-exports, and pricing of raw coffee beans around the world. <br>
- The data is sorted by: 4 different types of coffee (Brazilian Naturals, Colombian Milds, Other Milds, & Robustas) in the 1990s & 2010s (scatter plots), top 5 importers (bar & line graphs), and top 5 re-exporters (pie chart).<br> 

Summary of efforts for ethical considerations: <br>

One of the main reasons for the International Coffee Organization (ICO) establishment was to provide a set of fair standards to strenghten the global coffee industry. They pride themselves on bringing together exports/imports of coffee of at least 93% of the world coffee production and 63% of world consumption. One of the reasons behind their success is the set of ethical standards that are applied in their scope of work. Some of these include but are not limited to:<br>

- Fair compensation to farmers by establishing the ICO Composite Indicator Price (I-CIP). It doesn't only provide a benchmark for the price of raw coffee beans but also a fair compensation to coffee producing farmers around the world.<br>
- Transparency about the coffee sourcing origins to help build trust with governments worlwide and private sectors.<br>
- Cultural Sensitivity to commit sustainability, social responsibility, and respect to the coffee producing communities around the world.<br>

Limitations with dataset: <br>
- The most recent data provided by the ICO is from 2018. <br>
- Only two types of coffees are part of the dataset. This may be an indicator that it doesn't have a true representation of all coffee imports, re-exports, and pricing.<br
